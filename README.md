# The 17th NTCIR Conference

## Abstract
This paper describes the methods and results of Team KSU for the UFO task at NTCIR-17. In the TDE subtask, we designed methods for cell type classification using exhaustive tree structures based on the spanning sizes of the merged cells in the table. In the TTRE subtask, we designed methods for cell retrieval based on the cell class. Scores on the F-measure in the formal run were 95.37% for ID81 in TDE and 9.18%, 4.08%, and 6.63% for ID99 on the Name, Value, and Total, respectively, in TTRE. Scores on the F-measure including the formal run and late submission run were 95.37% for ID81 in TDE and 32.21%, 27.19%, and 29.70% for ID127 on the Name, Value, and Total, respectively, in TTRE.
